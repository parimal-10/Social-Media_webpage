#What have I done
1. It fetches random posts from the unsplash's api, shows the uploaded photo, location, current likes, caption, profile pic, username.
2.  The feed page is infinitely scrollable, it loads 10 posts initially and then when the user scrolls down it loads more posts(Consideer that the unsplash's api only allows us to make 50 requests per hour, so it might not show any posts after the requests are exhausted).
3. I have created a dummy profile using dummy data which is same as an api.
4. In the profile page, the posts are loaded from the dummy data, same goes for the profile image, username, bio.
5. I have also added friends for the current user which are fetched from the dummy data for the specific user.
6. I have also added a suggestion section for which the data is fetched from the unsplash's api, it includes profile image, username.
7. I have also included a dark mode button which changes the theme of the web page according to the user's comfort.
8. Clicking on the website name i.e Coconut takes you to the feed page.
